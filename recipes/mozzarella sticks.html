<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Today we are spicing things up with these spicy dairy-free mozzarella sticks. They’re easy to make, are perfect for parties, and nobody will believe they’re vegan!  </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Just Egg</li>
    <li>Sriracha</li>
    <li>Bread crumbs </li>
    <li>Spices: garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, smoked paprika</li>
    <li>Dairy-free cheese</li>
    <li>Oil</li>

</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>Take 3 bowls to set up your breading station.</b> In the first bowl add all-purpose flour and black pepper and mix. In the second, add liquid egg substitute and sriracha and mix. In the third, add the bread crumbs and spices then mix them together.</li>
    <li><b>Coat a cheese stick in the flour mixture first, then in the vegan egg mixture, and finally in the seasoned bread crumbs. </b> Set aside and repeat this process until all of the mozzarella sticks are coated. </li>
    <li><b>In a large pan heat a neutral high-heat oil to 350 degrees F. </b>Fry mozzarella sticks until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Once fried, place on a paper towel-lined plate to cool slightly.</li>
    <li><b>Preheat the oven.</b> These cookies bake at 350°F and line a couple of baking sheets with parchment paper or a reusable baking mat. This recipe makes about 36 cookies, so you’ll likely need to bake in batches. </li>
    <li><b>Scoop your cookie dough. </b>Using a 1 tablespoon-sized scooper, drop mounds of chocolate chip cookie dough onto the baking sheet, leaving about 2” between each cookie dough mound. No need to press them down – they’ll spread perfectly on their own! </li>
    <li><b>Garnish. </b>Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with your favorite marinara sauce and enjoy!</li>
