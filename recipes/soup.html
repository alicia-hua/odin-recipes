<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This vegan broccoli potato soup is a hearty spin on our Copycat Panera Bread Broccoli Cheddar Soup. This version is nut-free and naturally lower in fat, but still just as creamy and delicious. If you enjoy creamy, cheesy soups, you’re guaranteed to love this one.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Silken tofu</li>
    <li>Non-dairy milk</li>
    <li>Nutritional yeast</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
    <li>Onion and garlic</li>
    <li>Vegetables</li>
    <li>Broth</li>
    <li>Lemon juice</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>Make the creamy base.</b> Add the silken tofu, nutritional yeast, and non-dairy milk to a high-speed blender. Blend until smooth and set aside.</li>
    <li><b>Sauté the aromatics.</b> In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, and ½ teaspoon salt and sauté for about 4 minutes. Add in the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
    <li><b>Add the remaining ingredients, except lemon juice.</b> Add the vegetable broth to the pot along with the blended silken tofu cream, broccoli, potatoes, carrot, nutmeg, black pepper, and salt. Stir to combine. </li>
    <li><b>Bring to a boil. </b>Once boiling, lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender and the soup has thickened. Remove the vegan broccoli soup from the heat.</li>
    <li><b>Season to taste. </b>Remove the vegan broccoli soup from the heat and stir in the lemon juice and salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
    <li><b>Serve warm.</b> Garnish with fresh chives and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
