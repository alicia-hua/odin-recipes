<h3>Description</h3>
<p>These Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies are as classic and delicious as chocolate chip cookies get! They’re perfectly chocolatey, soft & chewy, easy to make, and require just 9 simple ingredients. Plus, they’re made in 1 bowl and require no chill time. </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Coconut oil</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Applesauce</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour</li>
    <li>Baking soda</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Baking powder</li>
    <li>Vegan chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>Cream the oil and sugars together.</b> In a large bowl, cream the coconut oil, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy, about 1-2 minutes. </li>
    <li><b>Add the apple sauce and vanilla. </b> Mix again until combined. </li>
    <li><b>Stir in the dry ingredients.</b> In the same bowl, add the all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until a cookie dough forms. Lastly, fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula until well incorporated.</li>
    <li><b>Preheat the oven.</b> These cookies bake at 350°F and line a couple of baking sheets with parchment paper or a reusable baking mat. This recipe makes about 36 cookies, so you’ll likely need to bake in batches. </li>
    <li><b>Scoop your cookie dough. </b>Using a 1 tablespoon-sized scooper, drop mounds of chocolate chip cookie dough onto the baking sheet, leaving about 2” between each cookie dough mound. No need to press them down – they’ll spread perfectly on their own! </li>
    <li><b>Bake. </b>Bake these chocolate chip cookies for 13-14 minutes, or until the edges are slightly crisp and golden and the center is still soft. The cookies will seem under-baked, but they will firm up while they cool. </li>
    <li><b>Transfer to a cooling rack. </b>We typically allow the cookies to cool completely on a cooling rack before digging in, but you can’t go wrong eating warm chocolate chip cookies either!</li>
